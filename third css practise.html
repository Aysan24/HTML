                hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
    
                Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
    
                Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
    
                Lightness is also a <span id="p9">percentage</span>. 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white
